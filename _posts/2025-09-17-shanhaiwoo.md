### About ShanhaiWoo

[ShanhaiWoo](https://www.shanhaiwoo.com/) is a **Web3 popup event** that provides a chance for participant to learn, collaborate and display. It provides **scholarship** including flight tickets and accomodation. In general, ShanhaiWoo is a valuable opportunity that not only allows you to explore by yourself, but also brings people together.

### My Journey with ShanhaiWoo

- I accedentally received the advertisement email. Later I asked others about how they got to know this event. Some said their friends or communities told them, others found this on media platforms such as Bilibili or X.
- I applied for the scholarship as the cost was a big issue for me, but it turned out that I was on the waiting list. So I almost forgot this thing when I received another email half an month later that told me they could offer me partial scholarship, only for accommodaion. This was good enough for me.
- Unfortunately I could only stay in Singapore for a week. But during the week, I got to make friends from people around the world and knew their stories, including Africa, America, China and many other countries.

Looking forward to participate more such events in the future!
