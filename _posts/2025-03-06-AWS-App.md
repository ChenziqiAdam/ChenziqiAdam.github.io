### How to build a full stuck app with AWS?
**AWS** (Amazon Web Services) is one of the largest cloud computing service company in the world, which offers [free plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.html) that is sufficient for deploying some web apps. Here is my experience about **how to build a serverless app with AWS**.

#### 1. Register for AWS Free Trier
Register to get your AWS account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

#### 2. Start with Toturials
AWS offers a variety of [toturials](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/) that help beginners start with AWS. 

#### 3. Learn from Sample Codes

> **Prerequisite**: Nodejs and npm

Personally, I found this [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/?ref=gsrchandson&id=updated) really helpful, which gave me a quick overview of **Amplify**, **S3** and **Sandbox**. With this tutorial, you will successfully deploy a full stuck serverless React app with no cost!

#### 4. Stay aware of Your Cost and Usage
Although AWS provides a free trier, the quota is a bit limited. Remember to check your cost and usage to avoid unintended cost. But don't worry, AWS will send you emails if your usage is high.
