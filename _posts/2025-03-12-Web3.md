### What is Web3?

**Web3** has been a popular word for a long time now. Before we dive into **Web3**, lets first review the history of **Web**.

#### History of Web
- **Web1: The Read-Only Web (Past)** 
    - Imagine the early days of the internet. Websites were mostly **static** pages. 
    - You could read information, but interaction was limited. 
- **Web2: The Read-Write Web (Current)**
    - This is the internet we know and use today. Social media, blogs, e-commerce â€“ we can create content, interact with each other, and build communities.  
    - This era is dominated by **large platforms** like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. While incredibly useful, these platforms control our data and online experiences.
- **Web3: The Read-Write-Own Web (Future)**  
    - Web3 aims to give users more control and ownership of their data and digital assets.  
    - It's about building a more **decentralized** and **equitable** internet.

#### Features of Web3
- **Blockchain**
    - This is the **foundational technology**. Think of it as a digital ledger that is distributed across many computers.
    - It's **transparent**, secure, and tamper-proof, making it ideal for recording transactions and ownership.
- **Decentralization**
    - Instead of relying on central authorities (like big tech companies), Web3 applications (often called **dApps**) are built on **decentralized networks**. 
    - This means no single entity controls the network, making it more resistant to censorship and single points of failure.
- **Cryptocurrencies & Tokens**
    - Cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** are native to Web3. 
    - They are used for transactions, governance, and incentivizing participation in these decentralized networks.  
    - Tokens can also represent ownership of digital assets, like art, music, or even virtual land (NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens).
