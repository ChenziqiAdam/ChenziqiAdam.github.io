### Synapse

**Motto:** _Your Personal Knowledge Engine. No Internet Required._

### 1. Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To democratize access to world-class learning tools by creating a self-contained, AI-powered personal knowledge system that works entirely offline.

**Mission:** We are building **Synapse**, an educational application (Obsidian plugin) that integrates the structured note-taking power of Obsidian with the local AI capabilities of Ollama. Our mission is to empower students in remote and low-connectivity areas to actively build, connect, and explore knowledge, transforming learning from a passive consumption activity into an active, personalized journey.

### 3. The Problem

Students in remote areas face a multi-faceted educational gap:

1. **The Connectivity Barrier:** Reliance on cloud-based AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and learning platforms (Khan Academy, Coursera) is a non-starter. Unreliable or non-existent internet access creates a significant disadvantage.
    
2. **Passive Learning:** Traditional learning materials are often static (PDFs, textbooks). Even video lectures promote passive consumption. Students lack interactive tools to question, deconstruct, and synthesize information.
    
3. **Ephemeral Chat Interfaces:** Standard AI chatbots provide answers in a linear, conversational format. This interaction is fleeting. The knowledge isn't structured, integrated, or retained in a way that builds a lasting, interconnected understanding. The context is lost once the window is closed.
    
### 4. Target Audience (Persona)

**Name:** Priya

- **Age:** 17
    
- **Location:** A small town with intermittent, slow internet connectivity.
    
- **Goal:** Preparing for university entrance exams in subjects like Physics, Biology, and History.
    
- **Resources:** A moderately powerful, second-hand laptop. A collection of digital textbooks (PDFs) and notes.
    
- **Pain Points:**
    
    - "I get stuck on a concept in my physics textbook, and there's no one to ask. Searching online takes forever and often fails."
        
    - "My notes are just a bunch of disconnected documents. I know concepts are related, but I can't see how."
        
    - "I tried a chatbot on my phone when I had a signal, but I forgot the explanation later. I wish I could have saved it and linked it to my class notes."
        
### 5. The Solution: Synapse - The Gamechanger

Synapse is not another chatbot. It's a **knowledge co-processor**. It integrates Ollama directly into the Obsidian environment to generate structured, interlinked notes, transforming the user's knowledge vault into a dynamic, living organism.

**The core paradigm shift:** Instead of asking a question and getting a text answer, the user gives a command, and the AI **builds a piece of their knowledge graph.**

**User Experience Flow:**

1. Priya is reading a note about `Cellular Respiration`. She highlights the term `ATP Synthase`.
    
2. She right-clicks (or uses a command palette) and selects an AI action: **"Explain & Create Note"**.
    
3. Synapse, powered by a local Ollama model, generates a new note titled `ATP Synthase`.md.
    
    - This new note contains a clear explanation, a simple analogy, and key properties.
        
    - Crucially, Synapse automatically embeds a link to this new note `[[ATP Synthase]]` back in the original `Cellular Respiration` note right in place.
        
4. The knowledge graph instantly updates, showing a new node for `ATP Synthase` connected to `Cellular Respiration`.
    
5. Priya can then ask a follow-up question within the `ATP Synthase` note, like **"Create Flashcards for this"**, and the AI appends a section with markdown-based flashcard syntax.
    
This is a **generative notes experience**, not a chat experience. The AI's output becomes a permanent, connected part of the student's own knowledge base.

### 6. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

**Goal:** To validate the core value proposition: generating structured, interconnected knowledge offline is superior to ephemeral chat. This phase focuses on seamless setup and foundational generative tools.

- **Feature 1: One-Click Installer**
    
    - **Description:** A platform-native installer (Windows, macOS, Linux) that bundles Obsidian, Ollama, a pre-selected efficient LLM (e.g., `Phi-3-mini`), and the Synapse plugin.
        
    - **User Value:** Eliminates technical barriers. Users download a single file, click "install," and have a fully functional learning environment ready to use. This simplicity is crucial for our target audience.

- **Feature 2: Generative Command: "Explain & Link"**
    
    - **Description:** Users highlight any text (e.g., "Mitochondrial Eve") and invoke this command. The AI generates a new note explaining the concept and embeds a link `[[Mitochondrial Eve]]` in the original note.
        
    - **User Value:** Drives the growth of a personal knowledge base. Learning becomes an active process of building a connected, personalized encyclopedia.

- **Feature 3: Generative Command: "Summarize Note"**
    
    - **Description:** The AI reads the current note and generates a concise 3-5 bullet point summary, placed at the top of the note.
        
    - **User Value:** Provides quick overviews of dense notes, ideal for last-minute reviews or exam preparation.

- **Feature 4: Generative Command: "Create Flashcards"**
    
    - **Description:** The AI identifies key terms and definitions from selected text or an entire note and generates Q&A pairs in markdown format (e.g., `Term::Definition`).
        
    - **User Value:** Instantly transforms notes into study materials for active recall, enhancing memorization and retention.

- **Feature 5: Automatic Knowledge Graphing**
    
    - **Description:** Leverages Obsidian's core functionality to visually represent relationships between notes. Every "Explain & Link" action updates the knowledge graph in real time.
        
    - **User Value:** Offers an intuitive, visual way to explore and understand connections between concepts, fostering a deeper understanding of the material.

- **Feature 6: Persistent Chat History**
    
    - **Description:** Records live chat interactions in a dedicated note, integrating conversational insights into the knowledge base.
        
    - **User Value:** Combines the familiarity of chat interfaces with the permanence of structured notes, ensuring no valuable context or information is lost.
