# Finally set up!
My homepage is now set up! I mean the most basic part.

- 6.26 Set up **GitHub Pages**
- 6.27 Trial and error
- 6.28 Set up **Minimal Mistakes** via remote-theme with the help of ChatGPT
- 6.29 Trial and error
- 6.30 Set up author profile and **images** with the help of Google (more specificlly StackOverflow)

I just find it is really **life-saving** to learn how to search for information effectively.
