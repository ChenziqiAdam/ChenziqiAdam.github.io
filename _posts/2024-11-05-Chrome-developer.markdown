### How to become Chrome Extension developer?
It is helpful to build **Chrome Extension** to accumulate real world experience, give your a sence of achievements and even add to your income! See my first extension **"Gentle Time Reminder** [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gentle-time-reminder/ohoebhfifcpnhkhoihjlnmadbmamdinj).

#### 1. Start with Google Official Tutorials
The Google official tutorials about Chrome Extensions are helpful and plain to understand. It helps you to  have a basic understanding of Chrome Extensions. See [the overview](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started) and buld your first Hello World extension!
> **Note**: I noticed that current AI does not handle this field well, maybe due to outdated information. But **Claude** is good.

#### 2. Register your Chrome Developer Account
Check out [the official docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/register) and follow its steps.
>**Note**: If you have difficulty regarding pay the registration fee (**US dollars**), try [Wild Card](https://bewildcard.com). It provides worldwide services, e.g. **OpenAI subscriptions and API**. You can use it anywhere you are required to pay in US dollars. It can also provide you overseas phone number to register for **Claude account**. Don't forget to use my **invitation code** for a discount: `OEE2TAYT`.

#### 3. Pulich your Chrome Extension
I think the Chrome docs are well written. But if you want your extensions for commercial purposes, you need to provide necessary personal informations, e.g. ID card. Otherwise, you should choose **non-trader** account.

Now it is done!
