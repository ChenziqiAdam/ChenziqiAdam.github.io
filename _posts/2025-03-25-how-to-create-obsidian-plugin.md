### How to create your own Obsidian plugin?

The unique advantage of **Obsidan** is the sufficiency of its **community plugins**. Almost whenever you want to add some functionality to your Obsidian, you can find someone who has similar needs and have developed a plugin to solve it! The community plugins are helpful and complementary. 

However, there are always some cases when you cannot find a satisfactory plugin. Why not **develop your own plugin**?

#### Build Your Plugin

The [official developer document](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin) is clear and well-written. With advance AI like Cursor, you can easily develop your own plugin. You can read my blog about [how to leverage Cursor](https://ghost04718.github.io/cs/skills/2024/12/14/Cursor-tip.html). Remember to test it yourself!

### Submit Your Plugin

The [official manual](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Submit+your+plugin) is well-structured.

> Here are some notes that you should check before submission, which will save you some time.
> - Do not use the word "setting" in your plugin settings page
> - Use sentence case in your setting page
> - Avoid unnecessary logging, which affects your plugin performance

Here are the [official guidelines](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines).
